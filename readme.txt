Mura Google News Sitemaps adds automated Google News Sitemap generation for Mura CMS.

The Mura Google News Sitemaps Plugin is licensed under the GPL 2.0 license

NOTE: Mura CMS 6.1 has removed ColdSpring. Version 3.0 of this plugin (current version)
has removed coldspring as well. If you have an older version of Mura (pre 5.6) and/or Adobe ColdFusion 8,
you may have better luck with the old_5.x_ version as 3.0 will require Adobe ColdFusion 9+ 

This plugin is a fork of the "Meld Google Sitemaps" plugin originally created by Meld Solutions
and is used with permission.  Most of the code originally existed as part of the Meld Google Sitemaps plugin
and was modified as necessary to provide the "Google News Sitemap" functionality.

Thank you to Grant Shepert / Meld Solutions for providing the original source code and granting permission
to modify it as needed.

NOTE: As of March 2017 I've stopped testing for Mura 6 support.  As I add some new features this plugin
will only be supported on Mura 7+.  There is now a "v6" branch with all of the original Mura 6 code you
can use for support on older sites.
